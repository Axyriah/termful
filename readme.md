Did you ever want to make Discord look like a command-line interface?

Discord Dark Mode is required for this to work. Compact mode is recommended for a better experience.

## Installation

This is a Powercord plugin, so you can use it in Replugged or any other Powercord-based client mod just by cloning this repository
at the themes folder.
